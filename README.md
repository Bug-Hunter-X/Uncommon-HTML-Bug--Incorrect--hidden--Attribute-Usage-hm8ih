# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect 'hidden' Attribute Usage

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the use of the `hidden` attribute in HTML.  The bug involves the unexpected behavior of the `hidden` attribute when manipulated using JavaScript.  The element may not appear initially, or it may flash unexpectedly.  The solution showcases the correct approach, ensuring smooth transitions when dynamically changing the visibility of elements.

## Bug Description

The `hidden` attribute is used in HTML to visually hide an element.  However, if the `hidden` attribute is set with JavaScript and subsequently changed to `false` (visible) after an initial display, the element might not render as expected.  This is especially noticeable with larger elements or elements involved in dynamic page updates.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates the recommended approach: using CSS to directly change the `display` property for smoother transitions and visual stability of the element.
